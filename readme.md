# Signup page React Project

Welcome to the AhmedApp React project repository! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository by running: "git clone [git@github.com](https://github.com/AhmadGitacc/Reactrepo.git)" in your 'git bash'**

2. **Install Dependencies:**
After cloning the repository, navigate to both the root directory by typing "cd React signup" and the 'ahmedapp' directory  by typing "cd ahmedapp" 
 and install the project's dependencies by running the following command in each directory:
"npm install"
like so:

![install1](https://github.com/AhmadGitacc/Reactrepo/assets/132521399/45a542ff-9654-478f-b89a-195475af25ed)

then:

![cdinstall](https://github.com/AhmadGitacc/Reactrepo/assets/132521399/945887d1-2b89-4465-bdf7-e72a7a55599b)



4. **Starting the Development Server:**
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Open the terminal window in the 'ahmedapp' then run:
"npm start"
like so:

 ![start](https://github.com/AhmadGitacc/Reactrepo/assets/132521399/732fa157-2871-4627-a5d9-fe5e5ca63d81)

then once its started you see this:

![started](https://github.com/AhmadGitacc/Reactrepo/assets/132521399/ab5aba8d-9cc4-43a5-9aa2-8bb9e4f0c2d9)

if it dosen't open in the browser automatically click on the link in front of 'local' then you're done running my react signup page.
